Features that are needed for better support of OpenCms development within the Eclipse environment
- New OpenCms module: choose location where to create the project on the filesystem
- Add helptext to the new module wizard
- New OpenCms module: choose to add module to a working set
- Optionally sync src folder to OpenCms (complementary to classes); in case someone doesn't use a version control system or wants to distribute the Java sources with the module
- Get list of available content types from OpenCms and link them to files in the projects
- Maintain properties on OpenCms files
- Implement Eclipse editors for OpenCms content types
